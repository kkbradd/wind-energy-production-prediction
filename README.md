# wind-energy-production-prediction
## About the Project
This project aims to analyze the relationship between weather data and power production. It involves collecting weather data such as temperature, wind speed, pressure, and solar radiation, and using machine learning models to predict power production based on this data. The goal is to optimize power production efficiency by understanding how weather conditions impact it.
